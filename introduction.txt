# Customer churn for a telecommunications company

This data-set is based on data obtained here: https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113

Predict customer churn (binary classification) for a telecommunications company, based on customer characteristics.
Each row has a unique customer id (not to be used for prediction purposes), demographics and a description of the contracted services.
You have to predict whether the customer will churn.

## Highlights

* The data is clean.
* The data has some categorical columns.
* The data is slightly unbalanced: 26% of customers churned during the studied period.

## Recommendations

Although the class imbalance is not severe, if you still decide to re-balance classes using oversampling, remember to be careful about data leakage!
Python library "imblearn" has a lot of utilities to deal with unbalance learning and it has a Pipeline class which is compatible with sklearn's Pipeline class.

After performing an initial data exploration, remember to only present in your project report the **interesting** finds, if any.
The presentation of data (via a textual description, tables or plots) should be short and informative.

In evaluating this project I am more interested in your correct application of model selection methodologies than in the performance of your model.

If your model has hyperparameters, I am more interested that your model selection procedure took them into account, even if you only try a few possible values for them.
Hyperparameter selection and model training shall not use all your computing resources for one week, but it should be set up "as if" you had access to a large computational infrastructure.
The only difference should be in the number of hyperparameter configurations evaluated; not in the rigour of the methodology used.

You should choose which classification metric to use (and motivate your choice!).
